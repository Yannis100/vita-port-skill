# Porting a game to the PS Vita

A Vita port is mostly three jobs: make the code build for 32-bit ARM with newlib, give it a
platform layer that fits the Vita's memory, GPU and controls, and package it as a VPK that
installs and starts. Most failures come from the second job (memory budget, shaders), so the
workflow below front-loads the checks that catch those early.

## Ground rules

- **Legal scope.** Port only code the user has the right to build (open source, or their own).
  The VPK must never contain commercial game data or Sony modules such as `libshacccg.suprx`.
  End users copy their own assets to `ux0:data/<app>/`. If the request is to port a closed-source
  commercial game by redistributing its assets, say so and stop; offering an engine
  re-implementation that reads the user's own files is fine.
- **Facts age.** The reference files were written in 2026-10 against VitaSDK series 2026.08 and
  vitaGL at commit `cdbba42` (re-checked at `a85cb8d`, 2026-10-13). Run `vdpm status` and check
  the repo before trusting a flag name. `references/vitagl.md` lists names that older tutorials
  and ports use but that no longer exist.
- **State assumptions about the user's files instead of asserting them.** Unless you have read the
  file, say "assuming your copy is version X (check with ...)" for the game version, build, jar hash,
  data format or install path. A port that validates inputs fails on a mismatch the user was told
  could not happen.
- **Say what you did not verify.** You can usually build a VPK here, but you cannot run it on
  hardware. Items tagged *(unverified)* in the references need an on-device test. Tell the user
  which claims in your report are build-verified and which are untested on a Vita.

## Workflow

Do the steps in order. Each ends with something checkable.

### 1. Triage: is it feasible, and which kind of port?

Search first — there is no single authoritative Vita-port masterlist, so cast a wide net: GitHub topic
search (`topic:psvita-homebrew`, `topic:vitasdk`) and plain `"<game> vita"` / `"<game> psvita"` searches,
plus r/vitahacks and r/vitapiracy release threads (Reddit's JSON API is bot-blocked; use pullpush.io /
arctic-shift archives or web search). VitaDB (`vitadb.rinnegatamante.it`) is a JS SPA, not
curl-harvestable — check it in a browser. A port or a matching engine may already exist, and forking beats
starting over.

**Seek a portable codebase before porting.** The original project may be written in a language with no Vita
runtime (Dart/Flutter, Kotlin, Java, C#, Electron), or be closed source with only a decomp/recomp route.
Before committing to a from-scratch port or a VM/AOT workaround, search for an existing **C/C++ or
platform-agnostic reimplementation** of the same project: translations of the save/format logic, forks with a
core separated from UI, GPL engine rewrites, or decomp/recomp trees. Model: **PKSM (FlagBrew)** — a Pokémon
save manager whose save logic lives in a portable `core/` (PKSM-Core) plus a shared `common/` layer, with only
the 3DS front-end (`3ds/`) platform-specific and host-run tests that build with no console SDK. It is 3DS-only
in-tree, yet its structure is the template for "portable core, replaceable UI": a Vita front-end can sit on the
same core, and a Java/Kotlin-only app with a C++ format core is ported by finding that core, not by abandoning
the request. Fork beats starting over — the same rule as for existing Vita ports, applied one level down: fork
the portable core, write the UIs you need.

Then read the source with the audit script:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vita-port/scripts/audit_source.py <source-dir>
```

It flags code that does not map to the Vita (fork, mmap, dlopen, x86 intrinsics, GL 3+ features,
64-bit assumptions) and prints the usual remedy. Pick the port type from `references/port-types.md`:

| Situation | Route |
|---|---|
| C/C++ source, SDL2, 2D or software rendering | stock `sdl2` package, SDL_Renderer on GXM |
| C/C++ source, OpenGL 1.x / 2.x / GLES2 | vitaGL (directly, or `sdl2_vitagl`) |
| 3DS/Citro3D code (e.g., MKW-3DS) | API emulation layer (`libctru`/`citro3d` reimplementation on Vita) → vitaGL; see `references/port-types.md` section 6 and [mkwiita](https://github.com/boomannotjeff/mkwiita) |
| Engine reimplementation (data files supplied by user) | check for an upstream Vita backend first |
| Decompilation or custom renderer (e.g. Direct3D 8) | write a GXM backend |
| Closed-source game with a recomp/decomp route (N64, x86 PC, PS1, PS2 lifts) | static recompilation → C, then native ARM build; see references/static-recomp.md |
| Android game with an ARMv7 `.so` (non-NDK, has JNI_OnLoad entrypoint) | so-loader boilerplate (`soloader-boilerplate`), FalsoJNI; see references/so-loader.md section 2 |
| Android NDK game (`ANativeActivity_onCreate` present) | so-loader boilerplate with `NDK_PORT=ON`, FalsoNDK submodule; see references/so-loader.md section 2 |
| Game written for a runner (Lua, GameMaker, Godot 3) | port or reuse the runner, not the game |
| Java / libGDX game (GL 2.0 class) | ahead-of-time translation: TeaVM C backend (Vita precedent) or Clearwing VM (real threads, GPL); compare them in the plan; see `references/java-teavm.md` |

Decline or scope down, and say why, when the game needs: GL 3.3+ core / geometry / compute shaders,
64-bit-only code, a JIT that only emits x86 (ARM JITs work; `references/runtime.md` section 4b), Unity IL2CPP, Java whose core needs what TeaVM and vitaGL lack (runtime
class loading, AWT/ImageIO, `Gdx.gl30` / GLSL 330; see the limitations table in `references/java-teavm.md`
section 2), or more than roughly 365 MiB of RAM.

**Closed-source commercial games** (Steam titles, Unity games): do not start building. Search for an
existing community port first (VitaDB, GitHub, GameBrew); some exist and are distributed as patches the
user applies to their own copy (Hollow Knight Vita is the model; see `references/port-types.md`
section 7), or as a local build pipeline run on the user's own files (STSPSVITA for Java/libGDX;
`references/java-teavm.md`). If one exists, point the user to it, state that you have not tested it, and list its stated
requirements. If none exists, say so only after searching, explain what a from-scratch port would take,
and offer alternatives. Never fabricate a placeholder VPK and call it the game.

### 2. Toolchain

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/vita-port/scripts/check_env.sh
```

It reports whether `VITASDK`, `arm-vita-eabi-gcc`, `vdpm`, `cmake` and the common packages are
present, and prints the install commands that are missing. Install details and package names are in
`references/toolchain.md`. If no SDK can be installed, still write the CMake and platform layer, and
tell the user the build was not run.

### 3. Build skeleton that produces a VPK

Start from `assets/CMakeLists.vita.txt` (guarded by `if(VITA)` so the desktop build still works)
and generate placeholder LiveArea images so the first VPK installs:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vita-port/scripts/make_placeholder_assets.py <project>/sce_sys
```

Get a trivial window or clear-screen program through `cmake --build` and `check_vpk.py` before
touching the game's code. A skeleton that links proves the toolchain, title ID and stubs are right,
which makes later errors attributable to the port.

### 4. Dependencies

Prefer `vdpm install <pkg>`; package names are case-sensitive. If a library is missing, write a
`VITABUILD` or cross-compile with `--host=arm-vita-eabi` and `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=...`
(recipes in `references/toolchain.md`). Static libraries only. GCC 15 defaults to a newer C
standard, so pass `-std=gnu11` for older C code.

### 5. Platform layer

Keep Vita code behind `#ifdef __vita__` (or a `vita/` directory) so upstream merges stay easy. Copy
`assets/vita_runtime.c` into the project: it sets the newlib heap, main-thread stack, CPU affinity
and clocks, which are the settings ports most often forget. Choose the numbers with
`references/runtime.md` (memory budget, threads, files, input, audio).

**Memory budget.** The newlib heap, `sceLibcHeapSize`, thread stacks, vitaGL's RAM pool, and any
`sceKernelAllocMemBlock` arenas all count against the MAIN budget (256 MiB default, up to 365 MiB
with `ATTRIBUTE2=12`). See `references/runtime.md` section 2.

**Float-Point Contract.** When the game uses physics, replay, or deterministic simulation, add to compiler flags:
```
-ffp-contract=off  # Prevent fused multiply-add (FMA), keeping IEEE single-precision bit-for-bit
```
Some games rely on platform-specific memory being zeroed. Two complementary strategies:
1. Compiler: `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` (GCC 13+, zero-initializes automatics)
2. Runtime: overload `operator new` to return `calloc` memory (C++)

Reference: [mkwiita's zeroed_new.cpp](https://github.com/boomannotjeff/mkwiita/blob/master/platform/vita/src/zeroed_new.cpp)

**First boot.** Trace the no-arguments, empty-config start path before the first test: on a Vita nothing
passes `--rom`-style flags and the desktop UI that asks for the data file is usually stubbed, which
shows as a blank screen. Probe `ux0:data/<name>/` for the user's files (only formats your reader
supports) and say on screen when they are missing.

Typical replacements: window and input (dual sticks, no L2/R2/L3/R3, front and rear touch, gyro),
data paths (`app0:` is read-only, write to `ux0:data/<name>/`), audio (48 kHz S16), networking
(load `SCE_SYSMODULE_NET`), threads (3 user cores), timing.

### 6. Graphics

- SDL2 2D: nothing special beyond the 960x544 target.
- GL: follow `references/vitagl.md`. Rewrite GLSL 3.x to ES 1.00 style, bind attribute locations
  before link, size the memory pools, and document that users need `libshacccg.suprx` in
  `ur0:data/`.
- Custom GXM backend: see the Halo CE pattern in `references/port-types.md`.

### 7. Package and check

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vita-port/scripts/check_vpk.py build/<name>.vpk
```

`check_vpk.py` verifies the title ID (exactly 9 characters), version format, the eboot's SELF
header, and LiveArea file presence, sizes and indexed-colour PNG type. These are the causes of most
"installs but bubble is missing" and `0x8010113D` errors.

### 8. Test and debug

Vita3K can run a VPK for a first look, but it hides memory-budget and permission problems and does
not run plugin-dependent builds, so a Vita3K pass is not proof. On hardware use vitacompanion
(FTP 1337, commands 1338) and `vita-parse-core` on the unstripped ELF. Symptoms and fixes are in
`references/debugging.md`.

**Vita3K caveat (community report):** some ports do not run under Vita3K at all (e.g. the gunbro port), even
when there are no Vita3K/PSV gaps for the game. A Vita3K pass is a convenience, never proof. For games that
won't start under Vita3K, plan hardware-only validation (vitacompanion + vita-parse-core) from the start.

### 9. Hand-off

Deliver the VPK build instructions plus a README with an end-user section (exact `ux0:data/<name>/`
layout, required modules, where users get legal data) and a developer section (build commands,
dependencies). Credit upstream projects and keep licences: GPL engines stay GPL, vitaShaRK is
LGPL-3.0. Use a unique 9-character title ID of the form `XXXXYYYYY`.

## Final report checklist

When you finish, state: which port route you chose and why; what was built (and with which SDK
version) versus only written; what was never run on a console; the memory settings you chose and
their basis; and what the end user must supply (assets, `libshacccg.suprx`, plugins with the
minimum version and supported firmware, e.g. kubridge v0.3.1_hotfix on 3.60/3.65 for `MemProtect`).
